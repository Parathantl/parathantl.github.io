It provides 6 months scholarship based coding accelerator program for the students who don’t get access to the state university or any other vocational education.</p>\n<p>Information Technology is one of the fastest booming &#x26; most significant field in Sri Lanka. Uki is a gateway for the students who are really fond of IT &#x26; technology.</p>\n<p>Preparing the local youth by elevating their talents &#x26; skills to get an industrial internship experience in the Tech Companies around Sri Lanka is the root concept of creation behind Uki.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The youth is the hope of our future — Jose Rizal</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a student of Uki 2 Cohort, I have a responsibility to share my experience to the society to engage more youth like me to get empowered/boosted &#x26; to be an IT professional or an entrepreneur in future.</p>\n<p>Web development plays a major role in IT jobs. In that way, Uki has a curriculum on giving a full-scholarship based coding accelerator 6 months program for full-stack web-development.</p>\n<p>Full-Stack web development means both Front-end &#x26; back-end development.</p>\n<p><strong>What is front-end development?</strong></p>\n<p>Front-end is what we observe in the browser. The page which is visible to a website user. To design it basically 3 languages are used.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML</li>\n<li>CSS</li>\n<li>JavaScript</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these; there are some frameworks which help to design the front-end like</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React JS — a front-end framework of JavaScript</li>\n<li>Sass — preprocessor scripting language that compiled into CSS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>were taught in Uki</p>\n<p><strong>What is back-end?</strong></p>\n<p>Back-end serves indirectly supports front-end to make website platform dynamic; that means we can make requests and get responses from a server and getting/storing data to the database.</p>\n<p>In that way; following languages were taught in Uki</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Node JS, Express — a framework of Node JS</li>\n<li>Mongo DB as Database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Above back-end, languages are latest &#x26; fast growing technologies in web development.</p>\n<p>As new technologies are taught here, students can get more opportunities in the IT industry.</p>\n<p>Is coding is the only activity we did in Uki…???</p>\n<p><strong>No</strong>.</p>\n<p>We have 2 clubs in Uki to bolster our future professional life.</p>\n<p>They are</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Uki Fitness Club</li>\n<li>Uki Gavel Club</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In Fitness club we practiced doing exercise, yoga &#x26; meditation.</p>\n<p>Full-time coding may become anxiety for programmers. To <strong>refresh our mind</strong>, to <strong>breath new air</strong> in the morning &#x26; to <strong>keep us awake for the whole day</strong> fitness club helped us a lot.</p>\n<p>Gavel club helped us a lot to <strong>strengthen the English communication &#x26; conversation skill &#x26; diminished our stage fear</strong>. Having Gavel club which is a youth version of Toastmasters developed the prepared &#x26; impromptu speech delivering capabilities a lot.</p>\n<p>We did projects such as:</p>\n<p><strong>English Inside:</strong> Every Monday &#x26; Thursday every student should speak English. If they do not obey they will have a punishment speech in Uki. For the first time it looked so weird, but later on, it became easy just like speaking Tamil in our day to day life.</p>\n<p>And another one provided by Gavel Club is Tech Talk. Tech Talk is a kind of session which would be done by a student per week on what technology s/he is special. He/She has to take a session by explaining through presentation about any technology s/he know. Through tech talk we got to know many information about the new technologies &#x26; practiced to search and prepare for our own tech talk every week.</p>\n<p>There is a huge opportunity for the students who graduate from Uki; because Uki teaches the students <strong>not to memorize or study in a conventional method.</strong></p>\n<p>It teaches a simple way of</p>\n<p><strong>Search &#x26; learn.!!</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to self-learning, we have practiced using some professional way of communication &#x26; programming tools such as Slack, Trello &#x26; Github. These are latest tools which are used by the popular tech companies around the world.</p>\n<p>To get hands-on experience in the technologies we studied in Uki;</p>\n<p>we did many in-class exercises, 3 Assignments with VIVA &#x26;</p>\n<p>4 fun works such as</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Getting API key from the Sound cloud website &#x26; creating an on-line music website by our own creativity</li>\n<li>Using CRUD operation — a note-taking app to create a note/edit that note or to delete that note</li>\n<li>Tic Tac Toe Game using React JS framework</li>\n<li>Authentication site with login &#x26; sign up facilities using React JS</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We maintained a blog to write what we have studied until now in Uki. The habit of maintaining a blog on what we have studied helped a lot to revise the subjects we studied &#x26; the writing skill.</p>\n<p>here is my blog : <a href=\"http://parathanuki2.blogspot.com/\">http://parathanuki2.blogspot.com/</a></p>\n<p>The instructors helped &#x26; cared for us to achieve the state what we are now.</p>\n<p>We were introduced to on-line code-learning sites such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Codecademy — <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\">https://www.codecademy.com/</a></li>\n<li>Freecodecamp — <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\">https://www.freecodecamp.org/</a></li>\n<li>Hackerrank — <a href=\"http://www.hackerrank.com/\">http://www.hackerrank.com/</a></li>\n<li>Codewars — <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/\">https://www.codewars.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the above-mentioned site, we started to taste the programming fruit.</p>\n<p>Having <strong>workshops on tech-related topics</strong> from the people who are well recognized in that field is a good opportunity for us to get deep exposure into that field.</p>\n<p>Main Workshop we participated during Uki Cohort 2 are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agile — Scrum — Project Management</li>\n<li>Ionic / Angular JS — Android Development</li>\n<li>Product Management</li>\n<li>Project Management</li>\n<li>IOT Workshop</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We got huge knowledge in Scrum methodologies to pre-plan &#x26; implement on our final project.</p>\n<p>IOT workshop was a fabulous experience to learn how new world is. All the things in this world could be connected to the internet. For example, the fridge door isn’t locked well… a security alert could be sent to the house members mobile.</p>\n<p>As a growing IT enthusiast in the technology world, this kind of workshop helps a lot to improve our self to emphasize the interest in programming &#x26; to learn new technologies.</p>\n<p><strong>Meeting MBA students from Stanford University</strong> gave us a new dimension. We shared our final project ideas &#x26; had an excellent conversation with joyful presentation style and got many ideas to enhance the idea more vivid.</p>\n<p>To enrich the student’s English knowledge; students are enrolled in an English course in British Council Jaffna for about 3 months.</p>\n<p>Through British Council, we become familiar with presentation &#x26; email writing skills for the professional life. Lot of exercises to improve grammar &#x26; speaking skills were enriched through this course.</p>\n<p>Normally in British Council; <strong>Jaffna people will step backward to study as the cost is high</strong>. But <strong>Uki offered it in a scholarship</strong>; funded by the people who care to help to develop Jaffna &#x26; Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p>The important key to becoming an IT professional is having a developed personality.</p>\n<p>To get such qualities Uki gave us a personal coaching session on</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic Finance</li>\n<li>Business model and Business model innovation</li>\n<li>Legal and Professional ethics</li>\n<li>Sales, Marketing, and promotion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>to mold our self for the future professional life in the Software industry.</p>\n<p>In personal coaching, we learned to behave professionally in work environment by doing activities like debate, role plays, learn to construct our CV &#x26; maintaining the Linked In profile.</p>\n<p>Definitely, I can say Uki turned my life to a different path.</p>\n<p>Every Uki student is grateful to the well-wishers &#x26; the people who initiated &#x26; supported. Especially Yarl IT Hub, The instructors — Vithushan, Dharshi, Personal coaching — Mathangie &#x26; ITEE Foundation.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Uki — A life changing determinant","date":"June 14, 2018","description":null,"tags":["Experience Sharing"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/uki-life-changing-determinant/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/split-map-strings-in-java/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Split & Map a String in Java"}}}},
