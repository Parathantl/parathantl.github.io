I was bit confused why there are different names used and browsed over the Internet to clear my doubt.</p>\n<p>At then end, I cleared and able to manage with some of my colleagues and juniors regarding what these words really meant. Lets get into this brief post to know what they mean.</p>\n<h2>Module</h2>\n<p>Module is a simple Python (executable file) file which contain collections of functions and global variables inside it. These files has the extension as <strong>.py</strong> [ Since, its just a Python File ]</p>\n<p>E.g:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">def addNumbers(num1, num2):   \n    return num1+num2</code></pre></div>\n<p>Just save this as <strong>demo.py</strong> and create a new Python file as <strong>test.py</strong> and inside it write the following lines of code</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">import demox = demo.addNumbers(5,6) \nprint(x)</code></pre></div>\n<p>You will see the output as <strong>11</strong></p>\n<h2>Package</h2>\n<p>The collections of modules organized together and kept into a directory. That directory is known as Package. There can be several number of modules can be found. Inside this directory there will be <strong><strong>init</strong>.py</strong> file. This file is the one which will always be recognized and run by the compiler.</p>\n<h3>Before getting more into this lets see what is <strong>init</strong> in Python</h3>\n<p><strong>init</strong> will be considered as a constructor when we are implementing Object Oriented Programming in Python.</p>\n<p>What is the functionality of constructor in Object Oriented Programming?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When initializing an object from anywhere in the code the class variables can be initialized. That means initiating the state of objects.</li>\n<li>Constructors are the one which executed at the very beginning when an object is instantiated</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">#a Sample class with init method\n\nclass Device:     \n\n  # init method or constructor      \n  def __init__(self, name):     \n      self.name = name     \n      \n  # Sample Method      \n  def say_hi(self):     \n      print(&#39;Hello, my device is&#39;, self.name)     \n      \np = Device(&#39;Personal Computer&#39;)     \np.say_hi()</code></pre></div>\n<p>So, you will get the following as an output</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Hello, my device is Personal Computer</code></pre></div>\n<p>So, I hope you may have got some clear understanding on why <strong><strong>init</strong></strong> used in Python. Similarly, when creating a package <strong><strong>init</strong>.py</strong> will be recognized as the constructor and will be executed when the Package is called for execution at run-time. The package may also can contain sub-packages.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Student(Package)  \n| __init__.py (Constructor)  \n| details.py (Module)  \n| marks.py (Module)  \n| collegeDetails.py (Module)</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Library</h2>\n<p>Library is having a collection of related already written functionalities and code segments which you don’t have to re-write by your own and allows you to perform many tasks by just importing the Library. Simply say, Library can also be considered as a collection of Packages.</p>\n<p>Some examples for Library are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pandas — CSV manipulations can be done</li>\n<li>\n<p>PyPDF2 — PDF file handling Library for Python</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">import pandas as pd   \ndf = pd.read_csv(“file_name.csv”)</code></pre></div>\n<p>According to the above code, We are just importing Pandas as pd to use pd keyword in the below code lines to access the methods. read_csv method in Pandas library will read the CSV file into a Data Frame.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s it. I hope you have you get a better picture right now from the above explanations.</p>\n<p>Happy Coding….</p>\n<p>Keep supporting my blog as much as you can.
